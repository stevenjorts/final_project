<h2> My Proposal for the final project.
	
	The story of the Porsche 911.

	I am hoping to create an interactive setting where the user will be able to move their mouse around to interact with images which will colorize, illuminate, possibly move, and create sound.

	I am a huge car guy, its something that drives my creative work and I am excited to be able to explore the idea of using this as a medium for an interactive piece. I am hoping the user will not only learn some of the cool general history on the generations of the 911, my favorite car, but also get excited by the sounds they make, adding that one more element to heighten your senses. 

	When the mouse is not over one of the images, I want the page to look rather blank and emotionless, so when the mouse does hover over said image the color and sound make that much more of an impact. I have all of my images on my computer.
